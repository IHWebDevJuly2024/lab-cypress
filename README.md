# LAB | Testing with cypress

## Introduction

This lab is not a regular lab, so you don't need to fork the repository. You will be testing the application you have been working on with Cypress. You will be testing your previous project (module 2).

## Iteration 1 | Fork and clone the repo

If you are not the owner of the PROJECT 2 repository, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

## Iteration 2 | Create a new branch

Create a new branch called `testing` and checkout to that branch.

## Iteration 3 | Install Cypress

Install Cypress in your project and follow the instructions in the portal.

For more information check the [oficial Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/).

## Iteration 4 | Structure your tests

As we saw in the lesson, cypress is going to create a folder called e2e as soon as we tell it to `create a new spec`. Make sure you've done this step in the previous iteration and you have a `spec.cy.js` file in the e2e folder.

## Iteration 5 | Write your tests

Now comes the fun part! Write your tests in the `spec.cy.js` file. You can write as many tests as you want, but make sure you test the main functionalities of your application.

Recommneded tests:

- Should load the page correctly (if contains the navbar, the title, etc)
- Should login (use your testing credentials)
- Should be able to create a new event
- Should be able to edit an event
- Should be able to delete an event

## Iteration 6 | Push your code

Once you have finished writing your tests, push your code to your repository. 
This time we are not going to create a pull request, just push your code to the `testing` branch and submit the link to your repository in the portal.
